Most application configuration is stored in `application.yml`, environment-specific files like `application-{environment}.{extension}`, environment and system properties, etc.
These configure the application context.
But during application startup, before the application context is created, a "bootstrap" context is created as its parent context.

Configuration properties that must be present before application context configuration properties are resolved, for example when using distributed configuration, are stored in a bootstrap configuration file.
This file must be named `bootstrap.yml` or `bootstrap.properties` (JSON and Groovy files are not supported) and be in `src/main/resources`.

Any properties that are normally in `application.yml` but are needed in `bootstrap.yml` (e.g. typically `micronaut.application.name` is used to resolve application-specific distributed configuration) should be moved to `bootstrap.yml`.

Details about what configuration properties go in `bootstrap.yml` are implementation-specific, so refer to the documentation for the various modules that use `bootstrap.yml` configuration:
